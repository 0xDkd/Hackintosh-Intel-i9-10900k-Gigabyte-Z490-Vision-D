# Hackintosh-Intel-i9-10900k-Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-D

![About this mac](/Docs/Specs.png)

Hello folks,

I have successfully installed MacOS Catalina 10.15.4 on my i9-10900k running on a Gigabyte Z490 Vision D.

You can find my EFI folder in this repository.

**Current Bootloader: OpenCore 0.5.9**

# Hardware
- Intel i9-10900k
- Gigabyte Z490 Vision D:
	- Audio: Realtek ALC1220-VB
	- 1Gbit Ethernet: Intel I219-V
	- 2.5Gbit Ethernet: Intel I225-V
	- Two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports
- RAM: 32GB G.Skill Trident Z 3600Mhz CL15
- GPU: AMD Radeon VII
- Wifi/BT: MQUPIN fenvi T919 Wireless Card with BCM94360CD

# Working
- [x] **Wifi and Bluetooth** (via BCM94360CD using a MQUPIN fenvi T919 Wireless Card). Replacing the onboard Intel WiFi-card doesn't work. See details below.
- [x] **Audio**: Realtek ALC1220-VB (AppleALC.kext, layout-id=7, device-id=0xA170, FakeID.kext, FakePCIID_Intel_HDMI_Audio.kext)
- [x] **USB**, all ports except the USB 2.0 on the rear panel labeled "BIOS". Disabled this due to the 15 port limit.
- [x] **Thunderbolt 3** including Hot-plug
- [x] **1Gbit Ethernet (Intel I219-V)**
- [x] **2.5Gbit Ethernet (Intel I225-V)**
- [x] **iGPU UHD630 but no HDMI-output yet**
- [x] **Sleep/Wake**
- [x] **Shutdown**
- [x] **Restart**

# Not working so far
- [ ] **iGPU UHD630 HDMI-Output**: You cannot use the iGPU to drive your display. So far it is only working for GPU-acceleration like Intel QuickSync technology. Your help is appreciated here :).

# Benchmarks

OC: 5.2Ghz All-Core@1.31V, no Power Limit

### Geekbench

### Cinebench

Cinebench R20 (with OC): 6857 points.

You can see my "old" Threadripper 1950x with OC to 4.0Ghz All-Core above(7916 points). The stock 1950x below (6670 points).

# Details

## Installation notes
1. Create an MacOS Catalina 10.15.4 Installation Stick (just google it)
2. Mount the EFI partition of the Installation Disk (I use Hackintool to mount EFIs)
3. Copy my EFI folder to the root of the EFI-partition
4. Go to EFI/OC and open the config.plist with a plist Editor (I use "PLIST Editor" from the app store)
5. Within the config.plist navigate to PlatformInfo/Generic and paste your serials for MLB, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID. You can generate them with the tool CloverConfigurator.
5. Change BIOS-Settings. See [My BIOS-settings](/bios-settings.md) for reference.
6. Reboot from the installation media and install macOS. The installation needs Internet. So either install a supported WiFi-card or plugin Ethernet.
7. If you get an error within the installation saying something like "this installation is damaged" you can try this workaround: 
 Delete Installinfo.plist on the installer disk:
  - Open the "Install macOS Catalina" Disk
  - Right Click on the package "Install macOS Catalina"
  - Click on "Package Contents"
  - Then navigate to Contents > SharedSupport
  - Delete the Installlnfo.plist

## iGPU UHD630

I have managed to enable the iGPU UHD630 but I couldn't get the HDMI-output working. I think this is, because there is no iMac out yet with a 10th Gen Intel with UHD630 so there are no framebuffers implemented yet. But I am no expert in this iGPU because I don't really need it since I have a Radeon VII.

But the UHD630 is shown properly in MacOS and Hackintool:
![iGPU](/Docs/iGPU-enabled.png)

I am using these device-properties:

```
<key>PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)</key>
	<dict>
		<key>AAPL,ig-platform-id</key>
		<data>BwCbPg==</data>
		<key>device-id</key>
		<data>kj4AAA==</data>
		<key>framebuffer-patch-enable</key>
		<data>AQAAAA==</data>
		<key>model</key>
		<string>Intel UHD Graphics 630 (Desktop)</string>
	</dict>
```

## Audio

I needed this to get Audio working:
- AppleALC.kext
- FakeID.kext
- FakePCIID_Intel_HDMI_Audio.kext
- layout-id=7 
- device-id=0xA170

The layout-id and the device-id is injected via the device properties.

The audio device has the PCI-Address PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3).
```
<key>DeviceProperties</key>
	<dict>
		<key>Add</key>
		<dict>
			<key>PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3)</key>
			<dict>
				<key>device-id</key>
				<data>cKEAAA==</data>
				<key>layout-id</key>
				<data>BwAAAA==</data>
			</dict>
		</dict>
	</dict>
```

## Thunderbolt 3 Support

In your BIOS set the following settings:

Settings/IO-ports/Thunderbolt Configuration
Discrete Thunderbolt support: Enabled

then
GPIO3 Force Pwr: Enabled
Wait time in ms after applying Force Pwr: 200
GPIO filter: Enabled
Enable CLK REQ: Enabled
Enable ASPM: Disabled
Enable LTR: Disabled
Enable PTM: Disabled
Enable TBT ASPM L1.1 & L1.2

You also need the SSDT-TB3.aml in EFI/OC/ACPI to enable Thunerbolt Hotplug support.

## 1Gbit Ethernet (Intel I219-V)

Simply add the newest IntelMausiEthernet.kext (mine is v2.5.1d1).

## USB

I use USBInjectAll.kext and created my own SSDT-EC-USBX.aml and SSDT-UIAC.aml using Hackintool 3.4.0.

All ports are enabled, except for the USB 2.0 port that is labeled "BIOS" and intended to be used to flash the BIOS. I had to disable this to stay within the 15 port USB limit. And I don't need this port as much as the faster ones. BIOS flashing will work anyways, because this is done prior the Bootloader config.

## Wifi/Bluetooth
You need natively supported Wifi and Bluetooth to use Airdrop, Unlock with Apple Watch etc.

Replacing the onboard Intel-Wifi6 card doesn't work because the m.2 slot is a CNVi slot. Which means that it only supports CNVi-cards which are made by Intel. I have tried that already, trust me. You can either Insert a PCI-Express card like the MQUPIN fenvi T919 or buy a special adapter (google for "NGFF to m.2 B+M-Key adapter") to get an Apple-support m.2 card working in one of the m.2 Slots that are meant to be used for m.2 SSDs. Then you also need an adapter cable to get USB-power onto the m.2 adapter to get Bluetooth working.

I used the MQUPIN fenvi T919 Wireless/Bluetooth Card. It has the natively supported WiFi and Bluetooth chip BCM94360CD. 

No further kexts needed (no AirportBrcmFixup.kext, BrcmBluetoothInjector.kext, BrcmFirmwareData.kext, BrcmPatchRAM3.kext, BT4LEContiunityFixup.kext).

You also have to disable the onboard Intel Bluetooth. 

In your USB-configuration this is the port HS14. Either add "uia_exclude=HS14" to your Boot-arguments or generate a USBPorts.kext with Hackintool and remove HS14. 

If it is still not working, download Bluetooth Explorer from Apple Developser (it is inside "Additional_Tools_for_Xcode_11.4.dmg"). 

Then start Bluetooth Explorer App, select Tools/HCI Controller Selector. Then you should be able to see your Bluetooth adapter e.g. Apple BRCM. Select it and press "Activate". If it is marked as "Active" it is working.

## Radeonboost.kext

The Radeonboost.kext improves the Graphics performance of AMD Radeon cards. I have a Radeon VII and it improved the OpenCL performance by 22% and in Metal by 38%. According to benchmarks with Geekbench 5.1.0.

## Language

Default Keyboard Layout/Language setting was changed to EN-US in v1.5.

If you want to change this, just edit this setting in the config.plist:

```
- NVRAM
	- Add
		- 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82
			- prev-lang:kbd | String | en-US:0
```

Valid Keyboard Values see here: [AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Utilities/AppleKeyboardLayouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt)

# Overclocking Experiences:

The highest Voltage I feel comfortable with for 24/7 is 1.35V.

I unlocked the Power Limit and tried 5.2 and 5.3 Ghz All-Core.

5.3 Ghz crashed in Benchmarks. 5.2Ghz worked. So far everything is working and no further crashing with 5.2Ghz.

5.2 Ghz All-Core is working with 1.31V and is stable so far.

Temps on idle: 35째C.

Temps while running Cinebench e.g. : 75-80째C.


Cooling solution: I have Thermalgrizzly Conductonaut applied, so fluid metal. And I have a custom watercooling loop with 2x 360mm and 1x 480mm radiator. Fans are spinning on minimum RPM until the temps reach 60째C. They reach 100% at 80째C.
